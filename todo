==== TODO =====================================================================
- do a once over of plist docs. check that file_io examp works.
- finish documentation for plist.r and plist.s
- add options to set the args for the plist.r and plist.s
- make a header file to clean this up a bit.
- update pd-guis on deken to version 0.2.0
==== REFACTOR =================================================================
- later, refactor the filename business in preset.c
- filename shenangigans is getting complicated...
    - take time to think about what use cases are useful, and what the exact
      order of operations should be.
==== BUGS =====================================================================
- bug in reading and writing, sometimes, a space or multiplies of the value for
  a param are introduced. Not sure how this happens.
- fix bug when gui is in gop.
    - probably due to a stale glist.
- when dial is small, the label doesn't have enough padding
==== WISH LIST ================================================================
- have guis virtually connect to preset somehow... mimicking max
- maybe the preset manager gets a gui that allows you to add presets by hand?
- potentially validate all input... maybe
- Default colors and pdnext colors
- have a slim version for pd vanilla
- think about having two update functions
    - one for motion and one for drawing
- probably create a tooltip_update function
- refactor the code so that other guis can be created
    - essentially rewriting the iemguis from scratch (ish) to not be a big pile of spaghetti
