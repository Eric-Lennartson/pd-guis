-upload to deken and create a git repo

Wish List (maybe come back and do these things)
    - potentially validate all input... maybe
    - Default colors and pdnext colors
    - have a slim version for pd vanilla
    - think about having two update functions
        - one for motion and one for drawing
    - probably create a tooltip_update function
    - refactor the code so that other guis can be created
        - essentially rewriting the iemguis from scratch (ish) to not be a big pile of spaghetti
