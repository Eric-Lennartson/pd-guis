==== BUGS =====================================================================
- fix bug when gui is in gop.
    - probably due to a stale glist.
- when dial is small, the label doesn't have enough padding
==== WISH LIST ================================================================
- have guis virtually connect to preset somehow... mimicking max
- potentially validate all input... maybe
- Default colors and pdnext colors
- have a slim version for pd vanilla
- think about having two update functions
    - one for motion and one for drawing
- probably create a tooltip_update function
- refactor the code so that other guis can be created
    - essentially rewriting the iemguis from scratch (ish) to not be a big pile of spaghetti
