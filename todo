==== TODO =====================================================================
- finish making documentation for plist.
    - add example files for read and write demo.
    - figure out order of operations when reading and writing.
- finish documentation for plist.r and plist.s
- add options to set the args for the plist.r and plist.s
- does reading in a preset also output the values of the preset?
- make a header file to clean this up a bit.
==== BUGS =====================================================================
- fix bug when gui is in gop.
    - probably due to a stale glist.
- when dial is small, the label doesn't have enough padding
==== WISH LIST ================================================================
- have guis virtually connect to preset somehow... mimicking max
- maybe the preset manager gets a gui that allows you to add presets by hand?
- potentially validate all input... maybe
- Default colors and pdnext colors
- have a slim version for pd vanilla
- think about having two update functions
    - one for motion and one for drawing
- probably create a tooltip_update function
- refactor the code so that other guis can be created
    - essentially rewriting the iemguis from scratch (ish) to not be a big pile of spaghetti
